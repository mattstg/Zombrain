    Bug/Balance Fixes
    //Fix the following issues in the game
    1) The walls are invisible, make them visible again
    2) Everything is shoved outside the screen when the game starts, fix that issue.
    3) Bullets do not seem to affect zombies
    4) The code that stops zombies and humans from spawning in walls seems to be bugged
    5) Set number of humans to spawn to 100
   

    Research
    //Awnser the following questions with enough detail to explain to someone who hasn't seen the game or code yet
    1) How and where is the animations for the different unit types controlled, both in code and editor? 
        For example, there is no animation code in Player, yet it has different animations than Zombie
    2) Explain the flow of the movement system of the Humans? At what point does the movement calculation differ from Zombies?
    3) Who has a further detection range Humans or Zombies?
    4) How do zombies pick thier targets to follow?
    5) Explain the use of the out keyword and bool return type in FindClosestTarget. Why do you assume that design was used?
